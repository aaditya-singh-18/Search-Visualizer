🔍 Search Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive web-based visualization tool that demonstrates how search algorithms like Linear Search and Binary Search work step by step.
This project helps learners visually understand the searching process through animated bars, color changes, and real-time comparisons.

🧠 Features

🎨 Real-time Animation – Watch elements being compared dynamically.

🧭 Supports Multiple Algorithms – Linear Search, Binary Search (extendable).

🔢 Dynamic Array Generation – Create new random arrays instantly.

⏱️ Adjustable Speed (optional if added) – Slow down or speed up visualization.

💬 Color Indicators:

  🟧 Orange → Current element / midpoint

  🟩 Green → Target found

  🟥 Red → Elements ruled out

  ⚪ Gray → Unvisited elements
